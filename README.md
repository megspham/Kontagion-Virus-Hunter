# Kontagion-Virus-Hunter

CS 32 Winter 2021 taught by Carey Nachenberg 

This is a project that I did in CS 32 at UCLA where I developed a game through C++. 
Basically, there is a hero named Socrates that defeat different monsters and the user 
controls him to shoot and gain points. 

• Coded a game where a player is trying to survive a virus attack by killing bacteria in a petri dish 
• Utilized object-oriented programming and data structures including stacks and vectors
• Improved readability and avoided code duplication through polymorphism and inheritance
